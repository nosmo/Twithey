twithey.py does the posting. Run it without an argument for a public
post, run it with one for a direct message to a username. As of
version 1.1 twithey uses a Python ConfigParser-friendly config file
stored in ~/.twitheyrc. The format should be as follows:

[account]
user: youruser
pass: yourpassword

[connection]
https: yes

At the moment the options described are the only ones that are
supported. I'm open to suggestion for extra options.

tweetlog.py will print out your twitter timeline. Combine with less
for massive damage. This will still require you to fill out the
username/password part of heywitter.py.

Once again, make sure to fill in your details!
